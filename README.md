# Celo Sage

Providing opportunities for growth and development in the Celo Community.

## What is it?

Celo Sage is a community-driven program where the community creates content like articles, tutorials, and videos to help developers onboard on Celo Ecosystem. In exchange for creating this content, contributors from our community are paid in the protocol tokens. The payouts range is $200 to $500.

## What is the Problem?

We are trying to solve two problems here -

- It's hard to onboard Web2 developers / Web3 beginners to onboard onto Web3.
- Web3 projects have limited content and resources to educate new developers.

The aim of the Celo Sage program is to collaborate with Celo Community and build better content for developers. Since resources in Web3 are limited and it's hard to keep up with the new projects launching every day. To solve this project, we introduce Celo Sage -

- Collaborate with humble community members to grow together.
- Write content and get rewards for doing the same.
- Providing a platform for founders to showcase their projects to the community.
